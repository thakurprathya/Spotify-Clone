-> for creating this app main thing was Shazam API (from Rapid api, https://tinyurl.com/4u77adm9)
we also used Rapid API client extension for vscode, it will help us in fully understanding how APIs truly works, and will
allow us to consume APIs very easily, it is similar to thunderclient extension which will help us to send api requests, but
it is integrated with rapidapi which contains large libraries of apis, other than this this extension also has some great
features like generating code snippets in multiple languages depending upon our request, generating output in certain format
, other imp technologies were tailwind and redux apart from react
-> Other than "shazam api" we also use "ip geolocation api" -> "https://geo.ipify.org/docs" its a real-time IP Geolocation API 
lets you look up IP locations accurately. used for around you page 

--> as this app not created using basic react start code for running deveploment environment use code -> npm run dev
    instead of npm run start, run dev will run the deveploment environment on localhost 3000, it is running because
    we're using vite.js, and script dev which we add in package.json (also other scripts will trigger other vite's work)
    Vite. js is a rapid development tool for modern web projects. It focuses on speed and performance 
    by improving the development experience. Vite uses native browser ES imports to enable support for modern browsers 
    without a build process.
--> there is different method of using env variables in vite.js they are exposed as "import.meta.env" -> https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html
    one imp thing to remember is ".env files are loaded at the start of Vite".

##used dependencies-: (install these using npm install) (or just copy package.json and run npm install it will automatically install all the necessary files)
reduxjs/toolkit, axios(for making api calls), react-dom, react-icons, react-redux, react-router-dom, swiper
"@types/react, "@types/react-dom, "@vitejs/plugin-react, "autoprefixer, "eslint, "eslint-config-airbnb, "eslint-plugin-import,
"eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y, "eslint-plugin-react, "eslint-plugin-react-hooks, "postcss, "tailwindcss, "vite": "^2.9.9"

we also used tailwind css for this project, using tailwind css we can apply css properties just by adding specific classes
for making our work easier we also installed a vscode extension tailwind css intelliSense it will help us in auto completing
the classnames and also will provide description for every class we added on hovering over it.

we also used swiper/react a lib used for adding swiping motion to our components better than overflow scroll used in topplay component
for top artists

in our app we have multiple time used ? after every api results this is because it checks whether data before it exists or
not if it not exists it returns undefined which is better than error which will occur if we donot use this checks and api
results fails

one thing we might have noticed in our app is when switching genres it switches instantly that is because of redux it stores
the prev results in cache to quickly make them visible
